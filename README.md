* Student Club Activity Management

=> During covid 19 my btech college asked us to make some tool so that our college could maintain attendance of each student, Organize different online activities, Form different groups like competitive coding group, web development some sports group etc, and host different online competitions. so we came up with an interface which will provide all this facilities including a student profile section where he or she can watch their attendance, their past participations, their achievements and their further goals. we made it using Reactjs for frontend, nodejs for backend and MongoDB data base.
